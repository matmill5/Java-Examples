# Java-Examples
JAVA Portfolio Examples

#### **Overview:**
This repository contains examples of my JAVA programming experience.
It's comprised of course-work assignments, interview coding exercises, and personal projects.
It only contains .java files, so you'll need to copy the files and build the projects independently. 
Each folder represents a separate project, assignment, exercise, etc.

Note: I have a handful of additional projects which I will curate and add at a later date.

#### **Contents:**
- Implementation of Common Data Structures and Algorithms (available)
- Elactics' Programming Interview Question (available)
- POS Terminal Project (incoming)

#### **To Do List:**
- Cleanup and Comment Code
- Add folder-specific READMEs
- Add project descriptions and screen-grabs
- Publish POS Terminal's code base
